# datascience_portfolio

Portfolio of sample personal projects developed out of personal interest an experimentation. Code is shown in both R and Python (R based projects are hosted on RPubs with code found in the respective folder). Data for all projects can be found in the data/ folder. For some analyses, to explore model structures, code from the broader open-source community is heavily relied upon. When this is the case, I have highlighted the core contributor of inspiration within the code. 

If you are interested in collaborating or contacting me for further details, I can be reached at ddil2149@gmail.com.

- ## Predictive Modeling/Machine Learning
  - ### Tabular Data
    - [Regression](https://github.com/ddil2149/datascience_portfolio/blob/main/banking_regression/banking_regression.ipynb): (Python) Review of a simple logistic, LASSO and XGBoost model, predicting banking data from UCI. Dataset shows whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit.
  - ### Text Analysis
    - [Sentiment Analysis/BERT Exploration](https://github.com/ddil2149/datascience_portfolio/blob/main/pharmaceuticalReview_text/PharmaceuticalReview.ipynb): (Python) Analysis of pharmaceutical drugs reviews, including AFINN and VADER correlation with review scores and an exploration of BERT's performance on perdicting the score based on the review.

  - ### Deep Reinforcement Learning
    - Next project

- ## Visual Analytics
  - [COVID_Impact_TSA](https://rpubs.com/ddil2149/684752): (R) Visualization of TSA checkpoints for similiar time periods in 2020 vs 2019, including a webscrapper to update the visualiation without having to re-download the data.
  - [NEISS Data](https://rpubs.com/ddil2149/726684): (R) Next visual project. Data contains stratified sample of US consumer product-related injuries by year. Looking to explore trends by year and trends within a year.
