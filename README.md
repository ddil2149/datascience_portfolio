# datascience_portfolio

Portfolio of sample personal projects developed out of personal interest an experimentation. Code is shown in both R and Python. Data for all projects can be found in the data/ folder. For some analyses, to explore model structures, code from the broader open-source community is heavily relied upon. When this is the case, I have highlighted the core contributor of inspiration within the code.
